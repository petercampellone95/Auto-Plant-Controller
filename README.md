# Auto-Plant-Controller

ESP MCU based device designed to function as a sensor platform for recording periodic telemetry data from growing plants and then transmitting that data over Bluetooth or WiFi to a Google sheets spreadsheet.

V1.0: Simple breakout board with I2C and SPI headers, an MCP3008 ADC for sensor measurements, and multiple sensor headers. Worked well for its application but far too limited.

V2.0: ESP8585 based, WiFi/Bluetooth capable, multiple sensor inputs, USB powered/programmed
    **DESIGN SCRAPPED, layout could be better, overcomplicated, WiFi MIMO antenna design isn't optimal**

V3.0: ESP32-S2-WROOM Based
